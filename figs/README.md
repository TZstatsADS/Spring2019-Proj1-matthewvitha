# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Figs folder

The figs directory contains the figures. This directory only contains generated files; that is, one should always be able to delete the contents and regenerate them.

Please note that the vizualizations for the TF_IDF, KMeans, and LDA analyses are interactive (one can hover the mouse over the different clusters to read the description of the happy moment), and can be further reviewed in this capacity by accessing the final HTML/Jupyter Notebook in the output file.
