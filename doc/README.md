# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

Aside from the two RMD and MD files, there are also two jupyter notebooks in which I attempted to try different EDA and Groupby's of the supersenseLabel data. 

These groupby attempt to establish different counts per happy moment of different POS and supersenseLabel. Although these dataframes were not used in the final product, they could be of use in future studies (i.e. classification analysis).
