# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

This folder contains the finalized html file, and final jupyter notebook with my analysis.

The KMeans clustering model did the best job in separating the different happy moment descriptions into discernable clusters.
